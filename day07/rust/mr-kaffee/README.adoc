== Day 07: The Treachery of Whales ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7[AoC|2021|07].

=== Part 1 ===

Parse input into a vector of numbers

include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

Create a function that calculates the fuel need for a given alignment position (after refactoring for part 2, this contains a cost function - mapping distance to cost - as argument; for part 1, this is just the identity)

I did not even think about anything more clever than linear search to solve the optimization problem.

=== Part 2 ===

For part two I just use a different cost function: ``COST_LINEAR`` solves part 1, ``COST_INCREASING`` solves part 2:

=== Solution Revisited ===

I learned about https://gitlab.com/akoeltringer/advent_of_code/-/tree/main/y2021/d07[something more clever than linear search from a colleague]:

The solution to part 1 is the solution to the optimization problem ``min_p sum_i |p - pos[i]|``. Since the cost function to minimize is V-shaped, the optimization is solved by the median.

The solution to part 2 is the solution to the optimization problem ``min_p sum_i |p - pos[i]| (|p - pos[i]| + 1) / 2``. This is the same as ``min_p (sum_i (p - pos[i])^2 / 2 + sum_i |p - pos[i]| / 2)``. 

The solution to ``min_p (sum_i (p - pos[i])^2 / 2`` is given by the mean of the ``p[i]`` values, so I start from the mean and look in both directions to potentially find something better.

You can run the direct solution using ``cargo run --release --features direct_solution``. Quite a bit faster than linear search ;)
