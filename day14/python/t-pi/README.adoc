== AoC21-14: Extended Polymerization 
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14

=== Info

Polymerization to protect the outer sub shell. Provided: initial polymer string and reactions (char pairs into which new char is inserted)

* Star1 (*): 10 polymerization steps: highest element number - lowest element number

* Star2 (**): 40 polymerization steps: highest element number - lowest element number

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and prepocessed into the polymer as well as a dict of reactions (e.g. 'AB': 'C').

* Star1: Classic string action. 10 iterations work well. Easy to process and easy to count...

* Star2: 40 iterations do not fit into RAM. New approach: Count and manage letter pairs. Worked well, except for own stupidity.

=== Learned today

Had all afternoon that feeling, that I just need to find the little glitch, as test data worked, but not real input. But I did not test the 40cyc test data...

Only much too late found the error: no reset after the first 10 cycles to check for match with star1 --> ran 50 cycles ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
